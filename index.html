				<h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Nelson Mandela's life:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>1918</strong> -
						<strong>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela</strong> (born Rolihlahla Mandela
						<i>/mænˈdɛlə/;</i> Xhosa: <i>[xolíɬaɬa mandɛ̂ːla];</i> 18 July 1918 –
						5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary,
						political leader and philanthropist who served as the first
						president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's
						first black head of state and the first elected in a fully
						representative democratic election. His government focused on
						dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised
						racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African
						nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African
						National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1933</strong> - Intending to gain skills needed to become a
						privy councillor for the Thembu royal house, Mandela began his
						secondary education in 1933 at Clarkebury Methodist High School in
						Engcobo, a Western-style institution that was the largest school for
						black Africans in Thembuland. Made to socialise with other students
						on an equal basis, he claimed that he lost his "stuck up" attitude,
						becoming best friends with a girl for the first time; he began
						playing sports and developed his lifelong love of gardening.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1943</strong> - Mandela began studying law at the University
						of the Witwatersrand, where he was the only black African student
						and faced racism. There, he befriended liberal and communist
						European, Jewish and Indian students, among them Joe Slovo and Ruth
						First. Becoming increasingly politicised, Mandela marched in August
						1943 in support of a successful bus boycott to reverse fare rises.
						Joining the ANC, he was increasingly influenced by Sisulu, spending
						time with other activists at Sisulu's Orlando house, including his
						old friend Oliver Tambo
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1950</strong> - Elected national president of the ANCYL. In
						March, the Defend Free Speech Convention was held in Johannesburg,
						bringing together African, Indian and communist activists to call a
						May Day general strike in protest against apartheid and white
						minority rule.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1962</strong> - Captured along with fellow actvisit Cecil
						Williams near Howick and out in Pretoria prison. Many MK members
						suspected that the authorities had been tipped off with regard to
						Mandela's whereabouts, although Mandela himself gave these ideas
						little credence. In later years, Donald Rickard, a former American
						diplomat, revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency, which
						feared Mandela's associations with communists, had informed the
						South African police of his location
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1964</strong> - Transferred from Pretoria to the prison on
						Robben Island, remaining there for the next 18 years. Isolated from
						non-political prisoners in Section B, Mandela was imprisoned in a
						damp concrete cell measuring 8 feet (2.4 m) by 7 feet (2.1 m), with
						a straw mat on which to sleep. Verbally and physically harassed by
						several white prison wardens, the Rivonia Trial prisoners spent
						their days breaking rocks into gravel, until being reassigned in
						January 1965 to work in a lime quarry. Mandela was initially
						forbidden to wear sunglasses, and the glare from the lime
						permanently damaged his eyesight.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1988</strong> - Tranferred to Polismoor Prison in Tokai,
						along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed
						Kathrada and Raymond Mhlaba; they believed that they were being
						isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben
						Island Cape Town.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1991</strong> - Mandela proceeded on an African tour,
						meeting supporters and politicians in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia,
						Libya and Algeria, and continuing to Sweden, where he was reunited
						with Tambo, and London, where he appeared at the Nelson Mandela: An
						International Tribute for a Free South Africa concert at Wembley
						Stadium. Encouraging foreign countries to support sanctions against
						the apartheid government, he met President François Mitterrand in
						France, Pope John Paul II in the Vatican, and Thatcher in the United
						Kingdom.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1992</strong> - The Convention for a Democratic South Africa
						(CODESA) began in December 1991 at the Johannesburg World Trade
						Centre, attended by 228 delegates from 19 political parties.
						Although Cyril Ramaphosa led the ANC's delegation, Mandela remained
						a key figure. After de Klerk used the closing speech to condemn the
						ANC's violence, he took to the stage to denounce de Klerk as the
						"head of an illegitimate, discredited minority regime".
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1994</strong> - EWith the election set for 27 April 1994,
						the ANC began campaigning, opening 100 election offices and
						orchestrating People's Forums across the country at which Mandela
						could appear, as a popular figure with great status among black
						South Africans.The ANC campaigned on a Reconstruction and
						Development Programme (RDP) to build a million houses in five years,
						introduce universal free education and extend access to water and
						electricity. The party's slogan was "a better life for all",
						although it was not explained how this development would be
						funded.With the exception of the Weekly Mail and the New Nation,
						South Africa's press opposed Mandela's election, fearing continued
						ethnic strife, instead supporting the National or Democratic
						Party.Mandela devoted much time to fundraising for the ANC, touring
						North America, Europe and Asia to meet wealthy donors, including
						former supporters of the apartheid regime.He also urged a reduction
						in the voting age from 18 to 14; rejected by the ANC, this policy
						became the subject of ridicule.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>2004</strong> - Retiring in June 1999, Mandela aimed to lead
						a quiet family life, divided between Johannesburg and Qunu. Although
						he set about authoring a sequel to his first autobiography, to be
						titled The Presidential Years, it was abandoned before publication.
						Mandela found such seclusion difficult and reverted to a busy public
						life involving daily programme of tasks, meetings with world leaders
						and celebrities, and—when in Johannesburg—working with the Nelson
						Mandela Foundation, founded in 1999 to focus on rural development,
						school construction, and combating HIV/AIDS
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>2013</strong> - In February 2011, Mandela was briefly
						hospitalised with a respiratory infection, attracting international
						attention,before being re-admitted for a lung infection and
						gallstone removal in December 2012.After a successful medical
						procedure in early March 2013, his lung infection recurred and he
						was briefly hospitalised in Pretoria. In June 2013, his lung
						infection worsened and he was readmitted to a Pretoria hospital in
						serious condition. The Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba visited
						Mandela at the hospital and prayed with Machel, while Zuma cancelled
						a trip to Mozambique to visit him the following day.In September
						2013, Mandela was discharged from hospital, although his condition
						remained unstable. After suffering from a prolonged respiratory
						infection, Mandela died on 5 December 2013 at the age of 95, at
						around 20:50 local time at his home in Houghton, surrounded by his
						family. Zuma publicly announced his death on television, proclaiming
						ten days of national mourning, a memorial service held at
						Johannesburg's FNB Stadium on 10 December 2013, and 8 December as a
						national day of prayer and reflection.
